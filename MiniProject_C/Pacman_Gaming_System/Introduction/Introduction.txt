**PACMAN GAMING SYSTEM**
This is one of my favourite classical games.
This project is a console-based application designed for entertainment purpose. This project has been designed in the C language using code Blocks with the help of GCC compiler.
In this project, the user-defined header file is created in the source code. The external C files are to control the behaviour and moving direction of the Pacman.
